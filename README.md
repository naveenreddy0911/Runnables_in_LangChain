# Runnables in LangChain

This repository demonstrates how to use **Runnable components** in LangChain. Runnable primitives allow you to construct flexible, reusable, and powerful chains by composing components together ‚Äî much like Lego blocks.  
This lets you control flow, apply branching, execute in parallel, or simply pass through data in sophisticated workflows.

## üìÑ File Descriptions

- `RunnableSequence.py`  Shows how to execute components in **sequence**.

- `RunnablePassthrough.py`  Demonstrates a **passthrough** runnable.

- `RunnableLambda.py`  Allows you to apply custom **lambda** functions within a runnable pipeline.

- `RunnableParallel.py`  Shows how to execute components in **parallel**.

- `RunnableBranch.py`  Demonstrates **branching**, where different paths execute based on conditions.

## üîê Environment Variables

To use this project, you need to set API keys in a `.env` file in the root directory.

### üìÑ .env file format

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
